## Summary

Imagine that you are a Pokémon trainer where you have to fill out a form with your name and last name and then select your team of 4 Pokémon to fight in the Battle Tower. The task is to create this form with inputs, button and a **select component** to select these 4 Pokémon and also show the sprites of your chosen Pokémon in a modal.
